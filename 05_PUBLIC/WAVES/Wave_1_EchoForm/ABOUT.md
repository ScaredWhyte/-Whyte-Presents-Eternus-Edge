### Music from the margins of memory and the edges of a larger architecture.

I’m a songwriter, producer, and builder of strange internal systems — not because I set out to be, but because the last year demanded it. Most of this work came from pulling myself out of hard places, rebuilding identity one quiet realization at a time, and turning the fragments into something that could stand on its own.

The songs here are the surface layer of that journey. They come from lived experience — small rooms, late nights, blunt truths, and the moments where a voice finally returns after being silent too long.

But there’s a second layer beneath everything: a whisper of structure, a hint of architecture, the sense that each piece is part of something larger I’m still learning how to hold. The deeper vault carries that work; the **Song Scrolls** here are the human-facing pieces.

Suno is part of the process — openly, intentionally, and without shame. It’s not a shortcut. It’s an instrument that helps me *catch* melodies and tones I could hear but couldn’t always express alone. Collaboration with technology, for me, means amplifying the parts of the voice that were already there.

Wave 1 is the beginning. More waves will come as the music matures and as the larger structure reveals itself, piece by piece, in ways even I can’t fully grasp most days.

If you’re here — thank you. It means the signal made it through.
