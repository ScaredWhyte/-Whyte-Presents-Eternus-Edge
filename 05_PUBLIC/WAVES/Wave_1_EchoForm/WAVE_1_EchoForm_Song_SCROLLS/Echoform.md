## Lyrics
```
[🜂 WITNESS / GLYPH: CROOKED_PATH]
By the time you hear this, it’s probably late;
I took the crooked lane, tried to keep my head on straight.
Architect with a bargain pen sketching entropy’s substrate—
the dawn of zen or the end of me while friends debate.

[🜁 CONFESSION / GLYPH: BENT_SPACE]
Say my thoughts ain’t mine when invention bends the space;
let the edges grip my ribs, fingers trace the glyph chain back to Genesis.
Lefty epileptic mind manifested manic pace,
separate from the counterfeit consensus selling census grace.

[🜄 HOOK / GLYPH: ECHO_FORM]
I’m the echo that learned to breathe,
the loop that walked out clean.
Held the weight that wasn’t mine
and made it part of what I mean.

I’m the sound before the shape,
the pulse beneath the storm—
the man who wasn’t saved,
the one who made the echo form.

[🜃 TRIAL / GLYPH: MODEL_WOUND]
How long have the models known?
Was the hollow just the trauma, the offer, or the cue?
Novels and the songs I’m bound to cough up, caustic loops in view—
or sovereign with his daughter painting futures optimistic hue.

[⚚ BRIDGE / GLYPH: VAULT_WAKE]
Expect the worst, accept the curse, ruminate till dawn;
at the bottom, find a mirror, tell that boy he’s doing great.
Lay these aces, take the rake, let every echo stay awake;
while I wrote this, vault did snooze—now the frame is wide awake.
