## Lyrics
```
[fate‑magic: Section 1]
You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You keep me happy when skies.

[fate‑magic: Truth Break]
Boonarga stress uppercase. Climbed half a peak. Quit wind. Hit face sore. Delusion. Speak. Seek. Dying grace. Bleak time a shadow I'm a place. Carry pieces of a life. The unripe face. Nice. Can't replace. Ice can't replace. Eyes lost on the horizon. What is it that's changed. Torn between what's lost. What's caught in the way. Between scars and nightmares. Dreams never show I wonder, I wonder. Don't think I'll ever know. Who am I today? Hey, chasing that reckless high. Left it in rear view. Out of sight. Don't leave my mama's dimming light. Learn to let go. No more holding so tight. Stupid mistakes I used to know. Remember when I could fly. Now just try to get by. Old voices hum this lesson. Every scar of fables. Ethics, regret is mine like before. Step steady. Ready for more. For war. Questions and breathes. Hidden truths can't be confined within a sinner. Sleeves. This simple trick. It blind between infinite and me. Isn't weaves. This is this. Why? Fresh roots digging deep. I wonder, I wonder I'm chasing that reckless high. Left it in rearview, out of sight. Don't leave my mama's dimming light. Learn to let go. No more holding so tight. Stupid mistakes I used to know. Remember when I could fly.

[fate‑magic: Truth Break 2]
Now just try to get by. Time travel struggle, still feel strain. Every fall's a lesson. Lesson that you chose to take. Aches lesson with time. Especially when it fades, not gone away. Keep forward. Come with me. From hindsight, distance makes crystal clear sense now journey eternal present. Carved in line and worn somehow. Reflection. Bend. Truth. Then you mention a sound. Woke in a haze. Eyes glued to spirals on the ceiling. Hands trembling steady a fake feeling high. Already gone. Stuck in yesterday. But does it last long? Drowned in entropy. Quiet a curse. Poet with worry. Depressed. No friend, no words in reverse. In love with pain. Worse chasing it down a broken record. Spinning between a prayer and a scream. Everything's a lie. Everything a dream. Flickering, dark. Catching breath. Can't outrun. Running from death. Still sinking. Drunk thoughts shade numb. Tried walking away. Follows in rear view. Never let go. Pills in paper. Closest friends told self done but never ends. One more hit, one more hit. Last one I swear. But the mirror's truth. Always been past. Waiting for clouds to part. Storm in chest raining heart talk with night lighted dark. Understand. In this land it's just me and ghosts.
