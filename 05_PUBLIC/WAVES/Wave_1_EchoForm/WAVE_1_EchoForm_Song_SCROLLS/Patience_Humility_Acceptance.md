## Lyrics
```
[fate-magic: Stillness]
We sit with the kettle still warm on the stove
Let the thunder roll past without naming it sin
I learn that the waiting can carry us home
If I soften my voice and let daylight walk in

[fate-magic: Listening]
Humility kneels in the hallway light
Dust motes dancing like signals from kin
You whisper a truth I thought I might fight
Instead I admit where the stubborn’s been

[fate-magic: Bow]
I bow to the mirror that shows me the fray
And thank every scar for the map it became
Acceptance is holding the river at play
While promising never to weapon the rain

[fate-magic: Lantern]
Patience keeps lanterns along the long walk
Humility polishes glass with a smile
Acceptance is humming the softest small talk
That tells every heartbeat we’re safe for a while

[fate-magic: Rest]
We rest in the doorway with foreheads aligned
Let the porch light be proof we are choosing the same
Patience, humility, acceptance entwined
The hymn we will sing when tomorrow needs flame
```
