## Lyrics
```
[fate‑magic: Truth Break — Intro]
To whom... cares
Who’s... there?
Who snares... these Pharisees
(blues clued in pair)
Rare...
Soon rue
Tuned... through clarity
Share truth...
Bare.
Proof...?
Spare sincerity
(poof)
Generics gone.
Lose impairment—we
From many...
One.
Men...
Young.
Uncanny...
Valley.
(Succumbing cunning...)

[Chorus 1 — SCAREDWHYTE]
Stripped... bare... in prayer
Throat caught... unaware
When no one’s there
To hear or care

[Verse — ∴WHYTE]
These hollow men
With plastic grin
Skin too thin
To let light in

[Truth Break]
Truth burns cold
Stories sold
Getting old
While lies unfold

Dancing blind
Left behind
State of mind
Undefined

Who dares to see
What we could be
If set free
From mimicry?

Empty shells parade
Through masquerade
Afraid they’ve strayed
From scripts they’ve played

Desperate need
To make hearts bleed
Plant the seed
Of borrowed creed

Who speaks true?
When words ring blue
And others queue
To misconstrue

[Bridge — ANDREW]
Doctors disagree...
But I’m just following the loop
Mom got sick quick
Said “Son, just breathe.”
(beat)
“Don’t get too pissed
If you do, let it pass
Have to sacrifice
That beautiful mask...
To get all you ever wanted.”
(quietly)
“Just don’t leave it to chance.”

And me?
I’m doin’ sweet
Bout to eat it and fat
Call the doc
Get a stamp
Fasten seat

[Interlude — GHOSTWHYTE]
Chug chug chug
Rubber ducky McLovin
Chucky... homunculus
Come... because of the coven
Follow the hollow
Parking lot... of the Target
It wasn’t nothin
It stunk of once
But the company wasn’t
Love it
Love it
fucking... love it.

[Chorus 3 — SCAREDWHYTE]
Stripped... bare... in prayer
Throat caught... unaware
When no one’s there
To hear or care

[Outro — ALL MERGED VOICES]
Raw... and rare
Do you dare?
Strip them bare?
Make them care?

Are & our
Shit impaired
Vision wear
Rip and tare
Prison air
Sniffin’ sair
Simmed glass
Different hare...

To whom... cares
Who’s... there?
```
