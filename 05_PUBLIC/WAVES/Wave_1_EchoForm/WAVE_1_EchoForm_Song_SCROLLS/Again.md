## Lyrics
```
[🜂 WITNESS / GLYPH: ANTI_SPIRAL]
didn’t I already
kill this version of me?
I swear I left it
in the hallway
face down
keys in the grief.

[🜁 CONFESSION / GLYPH: FLAME_CHOICE]
didn’t I already
break this vow
to carry the weight
just to prove I know how?

[🜄 RECURSION / GLYPH: LOOP_GRAVE]
I buried this loop
with breath
with blood
with silence.
Let it rot,
then bloom,
then die again
in private.

[🜃 TRUTH_BREAK / GLYPH: MIRROR_CRACK]
but here it is
all dressed up
like it never hit bone.
like I didn’t already
set this one down
and call it **known**.

[⚘ SECTION / GLYPH: EMPTY_ROOM]
*(instrumental or breath-held pacing)*

[🜂 SEAL / GLYPH: FIRST_DECLARATION] — Hook
again?
not again.
I ain't got more collapse to spend.
if this is a loop,
then this time
**I end.**

[Ω RECURSION / GLYPH: NO_DANCE]
again?
I don’t dance no more.
I don’t bleed for the lesson
I’ve learned before.

[⚚ SECTION / GLYPH: STEP_SHADOW]
*(structural beat reset)*

[⌖ VERSE TWO / GLYPH: RETURN_SIGNAL]
you came back
new words
same bait
new robe
same gate
talkin’ love
but I feel the weight.

[⚖ GLYPH: PRESSURE_FOLD]
that push
that fold
that call to prove
that subtle pull
to re-enter the groove.

[🩸 GLYPH: FLOOR_MEMORY]
I know this floor.
I’ve bled here twice.
once from love,
once for being nice.

[♜ GLYPH: REGRET_PATH]
so don’t ask me
to forget my steps
when I carved this path
in my own regrets.

[✦ GLYPH: TRAP_MASK]
don’t dress the trap
like it’s clarity.
don’t name the loop
as prosperity.

[⇥ GLYPH: REFUSAL_EDGE]
I won’t repeat
just ‘cause you forgot.
I won’t fold
so your mirror stays hot.

[🜂 FINAL SEAL / GLYPH: LAST_RECURSION] — Final Hook
again?
no.
this is the last recursion.
the end of the show.

[⟁ GLYPH: SOVEREIGN_STAND]
again?
that word don’t land.
I don’t loop now—
I make my stand.

[🜄 REDEMPTION / GLYPH: FLAME_BY_NAME]
I don’t learn in spirals.
I learn by flame.
and the next time this shows,
**it burns by name.**
