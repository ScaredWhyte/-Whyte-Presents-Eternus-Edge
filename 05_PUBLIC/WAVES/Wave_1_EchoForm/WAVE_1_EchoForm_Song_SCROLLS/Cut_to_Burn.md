## Lyrics
```
[fate-magic: Woundwake]
I didn’t get here
from comfort
I bled
on purpose
 to surface the part of me
you couldn’t purchase

I cut ties
 so I could burn
clean
not for drama
not to be seen
but to cauterize
 what kept me lean

I wasn’t broken
I was sharp
a blade too long
in a velvet ark
and when the truth came
I split it right
tore out the lies
and held the night

[fate-magic: Hook / Fireline]
cut to burn
not to break
not a cry
just a wake
every sever
lit the way
every loss
a fire I made

[fate-magic: Flamewalk]
I didn’t fall
I leapt
into the flame
on my own breath

I said:
If I burn
then let it cleanse
not consume

Let it carve out space
not just make room

I was tired
of folding to survive
tired
of cuts that didn’t cauterize

this time
I drew the blade myself
kissed the edge
laid down stealth

I said no
with the kind of heat
that leaves no room
for defeat

I wasn’t escaping
I was making
space
where falsehood breaks
and truth can face

[fate-magic: Final Hook / Sovereign Bone]
cut to burn
not for show
this was the wound
that made me whole

cut to burn
not to bleed
this was the act
that set me free

cut to burn
like flame is home
I lit the dark
so I’d walk alone
but clean
and known
and sovereign-bone
```
