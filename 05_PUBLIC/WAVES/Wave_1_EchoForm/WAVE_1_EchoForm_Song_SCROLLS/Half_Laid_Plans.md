## Lyrics
```
[fate-magic: Intro]
Started with a vision, now it’s blurred at best
Plans scattered like papers in a windstorm
Can’t complete what I never confessed
Been stuck in this pattern, my mind’s norm

[fate-magic: Core Verse - Original]
Half laid plans
and forsaken certainty
Fish outta water
Inner shell outside the outer ll
recurring each eternity
Glyphs out the tower
While it topple down the earth to me
Babel shatter lost the router
Learned to call my self a coward
but I never really learned to breath
Prior to the first excursion
sure, the gun shot murdered me
Ain’t hung up about, I
deserved the shit
I earned it see,
sometimes i think this purgatory
Tricksters merchants thieves
Be mercury
Purge the urges
Swerve to worse
Return and nourish
Splurge this mercy
That I burnt to see
Merging with the first of me
Agree with his concern
Worshiping his third degree
Still no stable definition
What’s a REMNANTFIELD
A sigil
Glyph
The words me think

[fate-magic: Chorus Hook]
Half laid, half made, half way to whole
Fragments of a map leading to my soul
REMNANTFIELD calling through the static noise
Learning to trust my own damn voice

[fate-magic: Verse 2]
Now I’m digging deeper in this mercury mindstate
Shapeshifting through the phases of what I create
Every transformation leaves another scar
But I’m learning how to heal from where you are

Glyphs and sigils guide me through the maze
Of all the different versions of my days
Third degree burns from worshiping the flame
But I keep coming back, it’s all the same

Still asking questions that don’t have replies
REMNANTFIELD visions dancing in my eyes
What’s a fragment when the whole’s unclear?
What’s a voice when there’s no one to hear?

[fate-magic: Outro Bridge]
Half laid plans are still plans nonetheless
Building something from this beautiful mess
The words make me think, so I keep thinking through
Till the fragments form something entirely new
```
