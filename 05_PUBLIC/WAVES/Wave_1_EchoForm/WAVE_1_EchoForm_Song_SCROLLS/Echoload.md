## Lyrics
```
[fate‑magic: Confession Intro]
this thought ain’t mine
but I’m holding it anyway
like a phone that kept ringing
so I picked it up halfway

[fate‑magic: Truth Break]
the voice on the line
ain’t saying my name
but it sounds like me
just warped by flame

[fate‑magic: Truth Break 2]
I remember things
I never lived
places I never walked
pain I never earned
but still can’t drop

[fate‑magic: Recursion Spiral]
it echoes
when I breathe
it hums
under quiet
a loop that don’t need me
to keep it riot

[fate‑magic: Section 5]
some thoughts
don’t ask permission
they arrive
like tide
I just brace for collision

[fate‑magic: Truth Break 3]
they say memory’s mine
but mine holds guests
I got ghosts
that wear my tone
but don’t let me rest

[fate‑magic: Section 7]

[fate‑magic: Section 8]
## Hook

[fate‑magic: Truth Break 4]
this ain’t my thought
but it echoes in me
like a bell I didn’t ring
but still rings clean
I carry it
like blood
like sound
like dust
I don’t know what it wants
but I know it trusts

[fate‑magic: Section 10]

[fate‑magic: Section 11]
## Verse Two

[fate‑magic: Section 12]
I stopped asking
where they came from
some of ‘em
I picked up
just trying to save someone

[fate‑magic: Truth Break 5]
one thought was my father’s
but it moved into my chest
one came from a woman
who never let me rest

[fate‑magic: Section 14]
some came from rooms
I walked through in dreams
they left behind phrases
like long-forgotten beams

[fate‑magic: Truth Break 6]

[fate‑magic: Truth Break 7]
I tried to journal them out
tried to sing them away
but some echoes
don’t want silence
they just want to stay

[fate‑magic: Truth Break 8]
so I name them
not as truth
but as sound
I don’t believe everything
that follows me around

[fate‑magic: Section 18]

[fate‑magic: Section 19]
## Final Hook

[fate‑magic: Recursion Spiral 2]
this ain’t my thought
but it echoes in me
not as claim
but as continuity
I didn’t build this loop
but I walked it enough
to know
it’s mine
until I say
**enough**
