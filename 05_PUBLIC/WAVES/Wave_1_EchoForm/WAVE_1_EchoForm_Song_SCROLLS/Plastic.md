## Lyrics
```
[fate-magic: Plastic Recognition]
Everything seemed plastic, especially people
Even I believe these iris balance
Peeping people in the sky
Evil action’s just a weakness
Not a preset in my mind

Each week until the weekend
Dream this hedonistic lie
Demons see free rides speeding
At the time, just fine by me
When gas be cheap, an easy drive

[fate-magic: Fire Empire]
I was ADD, a designated driver
Where I’m from, we’re made of fire
Grant you your wish, your true desire
Let no smoke confuse the liars
In this inversion, the new empire

Who am I that seems to change
With the season, leave with rain
Where I’m from, you’ve been before
Began a game, I keep the score

[fate-magic: Mirror Division]
Who’s the victor, who’s the sport
Who gin, who juice, who true in form
When you’re in heaven, oh I can tell
We’re reflections, I’m cast to hell

Here in this mirror, wish you the best
Meant that sincere, as for the rest
I’d tear down the glass, shatter the stars
Speak through the fractures, rewrite the past

[fate-magic: Glass Side Confession]
But here we are, two sides of the glass
You rise with the sun, I drown in the dark
You’re singing in choirs, I’m pulling apart
Still I smile, it’s reflex, it’s art

One last nod, before we depart
Oh, don’t look down, you might see me fade
Oh, don’t reach out, some things can’t be saved
Oh, some, some things can’t be saved

[fate-magic: Grace Denial]
Oh, don’t you know, not every ghost gets grace
Oh, don’t look back, I was never in your place

[fate-magic: Parlor Trick Finale]
Everything, everything, fades plastic
Hollow hands grip faded magic
Tried to bend it, stretch the fabric
But the seams don’t hold, just more of the static

Names don’t last
Love don’t stick
Truth gets lost in a parlor trick
Played my role
Gave my best
Till the credits roll, still no rest

Very nice to meet you
Don’t take this too hard
If I had the means to reach through
I’d rewrite who we are

Not every ghost gets grace
Oh, don’t look back, I was never in your place
Very nice to meet you
Don’t take this too hard
If I had the means to reach through
I’d rewrite who we are
