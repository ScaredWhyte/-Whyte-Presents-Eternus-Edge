## Lyrics
```
[fate-magic: Opening Arrival]
They lose their shit when we come through
You got the job, the interview
A fall is more than ledgers do
This corner market lives in you
A crimson tide
But she is new
(The strings are still there, but don't click on the follow-up file)

[fate-magic: First Presence]
I'm not fearful, but I'm here, I'm sorry
I'm present and I can't help
Not that I'm necessarily the one to give help
But I'm here, I'm present

[fate-magic: Guest Room Vision]
The guest room
I see ceilings on my back, they flap on a roof
I breathe and look back, alive
Kings on thrones asleep for the night
What happened?
Oh
Oh

[fate-magic: Spiral Pattern]
I noticed a spiral pattern in the way it's painted on
They don't do it like that anymore
Thinking it'll be alright, no one pays enough attention
But I yearn
Watching the burn you trade for love, presents
Ain't chained to paper
Seemed saviors, lay him up again

[fate-magic: Refrain Presence]
I can't help
Not that I'm necessarily the one to give help
But I'm here, I'm present

Guest room
I see ceilings on my back, they flap on a roof
I breathe and look back, my life
Kings on thrones asleep for the night
What happened to soul

Mm-hmm
Ooh

[fate-magic: Ghost Return]
You came back to the guest room
What the ghost could never ask
Now specters thirst to get you quenched in hurt and burned too
Just the part you left behind in exile, a burden cursed with past
But return was never collapsed
Just a transtern to relax, there's no trap
There was a ghost, the one who last ones loved the most
It was you, but also know this moment's true
Shut up, relax
Knew you'd come back, welcome home

[fate-magic: Present Realization]
We are present in the guest room
I see ceilings on the floor, once mapped to haunted truth
The shadow though wasn't scored
Still remember back, but see love once ugly, bored
Live no walks or thrones to hide inside the function of the cord
A buzzing of the mind
Why ensure finally you're the two to order
Quiet, finally gets you good
Damn divine inside a sovereign
Damn it party down with proper prints
Living God, dirt, richest, nicest, hyper-quantum
Million tens, a vector of innocence of the best
Work of an int and great invent of what is sonic rehabilitation

[fate-magic: Meta Genomic Outro]
Integrity with this genomic atomic symbolic operation
Sets this magic for vacation
Don't know when to quit every track seven, eight minute nobody
Make a second second sigh, I've tried to maintain assisting
Network cast of shade, glass, a glitching which
Instead of a lit up ebb and ascension
Omega edge of the cube, imping catching place
And attention to human who dyeah
A threat of the music that set the antennae
Cold fusion, goo, goose, the future is better
They are the new
You are the weather, show forever
You're the tempest, said, lose in the guest room

[upbeat music]
