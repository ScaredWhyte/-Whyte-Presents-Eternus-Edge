## Lyrics
```
[fate-magic: Confession Intro]
Don't race to the bag, lap in the chase.
I lash at the face, time-lapse run laps in the past.
Overlap in the race, they want static, I'm active in waves.
Watch the conduction zapping the game, time is money, black mask in the bank.
Withdrawals fast, pocket the change, I clock in while they pocket my name.
Wrote my own check, now they copy the frame, flip it around and still look the same.
My past ain't passive, I pass them in riddles, hands ain't civil, I clap them in triples.
Mirror my name, what's back in the middle? Still me—flip twice like a palindrome pistol.
Level when I level up, you settle when the pressure's up.
Try to draw me out but the plot got flipped, page reversed and your script got ripped.

[fate-magic: Signal Blink]
See you.
Two beats of silence to feel the barrel breathe.

[fate-magic: Recursion Spiral]
Flip that twist, that number's all bent.
Bars go forward but they loop at the end.
Took my shot, still ricochet with it, every line I spit reads the same when printed.
Said I'm evil—leave when I craft these scripts.
Level my sights, never settle for skips.
Read "deified"; if I die I persist—read that backwards, I still exist.
Rap like civic collisions, impact split tracks and symmetries,
Image each line fold like a paper decision, same both ways—a fatal precision.
Stack up stats, no lag in the mission, shift gears quick, still drag competition.
Shift word slick, still track composition, watch how I flip, same fact, no revision.
Pull up a deed, saw it, did I wait it again? Still the same path, they tried to stop me.
I pulled that key, flipped the whole script—now who lost the plot? Flip that twist, that number's all bent.
