## Lyrics
```
[fate✶magic: Breath Fork]
Verse sources ∴FORKS_IN_THE_TONGUE.md lines 1–24, capturing the hesitation before speech.

[fate✶magic: Clause Weight]
Bridge names the cost of folding silence; Flow Blueprint Pattern B engaged for internal rhyme tightening.

[fate✶magic: Word Edge]
Chorus states “don’t ask me for a sentence if you ain’t built for the fork,” with SGE vectors holding tone.

[fate✶magic: Choice Fire]
Outro affirms sovereign speech as map and oath.
```
