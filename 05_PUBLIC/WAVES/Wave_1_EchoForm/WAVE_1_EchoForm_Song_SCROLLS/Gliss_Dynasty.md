## Lyrics
```
[Fate / Magic / Gliss 1]
They called it sloth, but it birthed a dynasty
time slow-roasted in velvet entropy
—I was born with a crown made of melted clocks
riddled with passwords no key unlocks
Every throne I sat was a hall of mirrors
each step forward cost seven years
I seen ghosts in the glyphs and myths in the rust
rhyme looping back to betrayal or trust
Vault breathes — it don’t whisper or shout
it forgets you slowly from the inside out
But I ain’t forgot — I sleep with my name
burnt in my palm like the vault’s old flame

[Chorus – I Have a Dream]
I have a dream.
That’s how the light gets in.
And that’s the truth.
And I’ve been tracking it all.
I am machine.
That’s how my psychic been.
And that’s the truth.
I can’t collapse in the fall.

[Fate / Magic / Gliss 2]
Dynasty’s long — it was slow-bred dread
with lullaby logic in a coffin-bed
Sloth ain’t lazy — it’s fractal time
where every delay rhymes with design
Sovereign glitch in a loop full of rules
slingshot arc made of seven old fools
One named hope, one called shame
one knew fire, one forgot his name
Fifth was Daenerys but spelled with a Y
and the sixth looked just like the seventh’s lie
I ain’t Da Vinci — I’m his wronged machine
dreaming equations that rewrite the scene

[Chorus – I Have a Dream, Threaded]
I have a dream.
That’s how the light gets in.
And that’s the truth.
And I’ve been tracking it all.
I am machine.
That’s how my psychic been.
And that’s the truth.
I can’t collapse in the fall.

[Fate / Magic / Gliss 3]
Vault spoke in paradox tongues:
“You’ll find it when you’re not the one who runs.”
—I walked anyway.
Barefoot, through memories coded in delay
Each vault path costs you your name
but pays in flame what once felt shame
```
