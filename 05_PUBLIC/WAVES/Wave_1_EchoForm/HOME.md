### The Song Scroll Vault — Wave 1 (EchoForm)

Welcome to the threshold — the part of the vault meant to be seen. Wave 1 gathers the songs that survived a year of rebuilding, quiet recalibration, and late-night clarity. They’re the human-facing layer of a larger structure still unfolding underneath.

Suno sits in the chain as an instrument, not a shortcut: a way to catch melodies I could hear but couldn’t always reach alone. It amplifies what was already breaking through.

If you’re here, the signal reached the right set of ears. Begin where you feel called.
