# Song Scroll Style Guide  
### v1.0 — Public Vault Standard

This guide defines the structure used across all **Song Scrolls** in Wave 1 and beyond.  
The goal is to keep every scroll readable, consistent, and visually clean —  
a blend of artist bio, vault whisper, and modern minimalism.

No front-matter.  
No schemas.  
No metadata blocks.  
Just the scroll.
